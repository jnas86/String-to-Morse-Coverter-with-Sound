# String-to-Morse-Coverter-with-Sound
<h3>Simple python Application,to convert string messages into Morse code and generate coressponing sound.</h3>

<p>This is a simple python application using dictionaries, user interaction with console via message, function creation and extra library winsound
to beep the sounds inside the program.More about Morse code usage can be found here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">Wikipedia Entry for Morse Code</a></p>


<p>Program Details</p>
<ul>
  <li>The program consists of two dictionaries. The first stands for associating the alphabet with morse signal combination and the second to associate the morse code signals
with sound frequency and duration.</li>
  <li>The main application runs through a loop where the user interacts via the console, sends messages and afterwards the messages are converted to morse code with the corresponding
sound result.</li>
  <li>The application runs eternally, unless the user enters 'exit' in the prompt message</li>
</ul>
